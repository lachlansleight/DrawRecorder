# Draw Recorder

This is a basic application that allows me to record 2D sketches and handwritten notes through time. The JSON data generated by this app can then be used in other applications to replay and manipulate the sketches.

Data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database (right now there's no security rules so if you're reading this and you're not me, please refrain from filling / wiping my database!) in the following format:

Sketch

  * name - the sketch name, entered by the user when saving
  * pointCount - total number of control points in the entire sketch
  * strokeCount - total number of strokes in the entire sketch
  * timestamp - millis since epoch when sketch was saved
  * strokes - array of strokes in the sketch
    * [index]
      * color - color name (not hex code) - it's up to the application to interpret this. Current valid names are 'default', 'red', 'green' and 'blue'
      * pointCount - number of points in this stroke
      * time - millis since beginning of sketch this stroke began at
      * width - base stroke weight for the stroke
      * points - array of control points in the stroke
        * [index]
          * t - millis since beginning of stroke this control point occured at
          * w - pressure for this stroke (1.0 if drawn using a device that doesn't support pen pressure)
          * p - position of the control point on the canvas
            * x - x coordinate
            * y - y coordinate


# Modifying for your use

It's easy to recreate this project with your own database, you just need to:

  1. Create a new firebase project, and initialize a realtime database
  2. Replace all instances of `https://ipadstrokerecorder.firebaseio.com` with the URL of your database

I'll probably be adding basic email/password authentication to this project in the near future so that I can prevent other people from writing to the database...
